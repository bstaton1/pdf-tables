This example comes from a manuscript currently in preparation, but I really like it, so I thought it worthy of including here.
Interested readers who have viewed the math symbology table example might find this description of the difference between $t$ and $y$ year indices useful.

```{r table, echo = FALSE}
library(magrittr) # for pipe operator

# read in the raw input table
tab = read.csv("colors-table-input.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, allowEscapes = TRUE)

# replace "\\n" with "\n": for kableExtra::linebreak()
tab = apply(tab, 2, function(x) stringr::str_replace(x, "\\\\n", "\\\n"))

# add line breaks to necessary cells
tab = apply(tab, 2, function(x) kableExtra::linebreak(x, align = "c"))

# set the color for cells not considered by model
tab[tab == "color"] = kableExtra::cell_spec(" ", format = "latex", background = "#D3D3D3")

# pretty latex column names
colnames(tab) = c("\\textbf{Year}", "$\\boldsymbol{y}$","$\\boldsymbol{t}$", "\\textbf{Age-4}\n($a=1$)",	"\\textbf{Age-5}\n($a=2$)",	"\\textbf{Age-6}\n($a=3$)",	"\\textbf{Age-7}\n($a=4$)")
colnames(tab) = kableExtra::linebreak(colnames(tab), align = "c")

# specify the caption
cap = "Structure of the brood and calendar year indexing in the state-space model spawner-recruit model.
  The brood year $y$ in which salmon returning in calendar year $t$ at age $a$ were spawned is calculated as $y = t + n_a - a$.
  Grey regions are years that are not included in model calculations. 
  Note that in order to have model-predicted age-structured return in $t = 1$ for fitting to data observed that year, 
  $a_{\\text{max}}$ brood years before $t = 1$ must be included (larger grey region). 
  Similarly, even though escapement data span until 2019, the model does not track recruitment states after 2015
  because no adults had yet been observed from later brood years (smaller grey region).
  "

# build/format the table
knitr::kable(tab, "latex", booktabs = TRUE, longtable = FALSE, linesep = "", escape = FALSE, align = "ccccccc", caption = cap) %>%
  
  # misc settings
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  
  # add a grouped column header
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c("Year Indices" = 3, "Brood Year of Returning Adults in $\\\\boldsymbol{t}$" = 4), bold = TRUE, escape = FALSE)
```

As an example of how to interpret this table, adult salmon returning in calendar year $t = 44$ (2019) at age-6 were the progeny of spawners returning in brood year $y = 45$ (2013).

_P.S.: If anyone knows how to get rid of the (barely visible, but very annoying) white cell boundaries in the grey regions, I would be very appreciative of a solution. I spent excessively too long searching for a solution but was unsuccessful._
