# Example PDF Tables using 'rmarkdown'

This repository stores a handful of examples of tables in PDF format I have created. It is intended so others can adapt the code for their own problems.

This repository was motivated by the [2020 RStudio Table Contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/), but I may continue to add examples to it.

All tables use the `knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::fun()` workflow, which I have been very impressed with.

Below are some screenshots showing a preview of the table created by the code in each subdirectory.

> Apologies for the grainy-ness in these images, crystal-clear versions can be found in the PDF in each subdirectory.
