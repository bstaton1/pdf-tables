# Example Table Summarizing Math Symbols

This example uses `knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::funs()` to produce a publication-quality table that summarizes the mathematical symbology found in a technical document.

This example showcases these features within the `knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::funs()` framework:

* LaTeX math environments
* Cross-references to equations 
* Grouped rows
* Footnotes
